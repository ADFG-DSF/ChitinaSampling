## Contribution of Gulkana Hatchery Sockeye Salmon Returns and Age and Length Composition of the Harvest of Sockeye and Chinook Salmon in the Upper Copper River Subsistence and Personal Use Fisheries

This project uses otolith sampling to estimate the proportion of the harvest of sockeye salmon in the Upper Copper River subsistence and personal use fisheries to have origin in the Gulkana Hatchery.  Proportions are estimated for each week from two fisheries: the Chitina Subdistrict (CSD) personal use fishery and the Glennallen Subdistrict (GSD) subsistence fishery.

In addition, age, sex, and length (ASL) contribution is estimated for the returns of both sockeye and Chinook salmon in both fisheries.

## Operational Plan

A previous version of the Operational Plan (from 2016) has been published and is available online.  The current Operational Plan (written in 2019) is very similar in all methodology.
